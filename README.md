3. **Create a blog post:** 
If you do not have a blog, start one on blogspot, WordPress, medium or anywhere else you want.

   :heavy_check_mark: [Link to your blog/WordPress/medium - please write your first post to ensure you are the owner](https://medium.com/@bolah2009/my-first-medium-story-b64036431713)

2. **Design Task:** 
Use Figma to design yourself a home page. Your page must follow a particular format: Your picture on the top left corner. Links below your picture About, Blog, Projects. Below that are three icons with links to your social media. On the right (separated by a line from the left section), will be some welcoming information for you.
