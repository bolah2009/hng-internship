# HNG Internship 5
### Stage 1

1. **Git Task:** 
Sign up for GitHub. Create a personal repository. Commit a file. Pull the file. Change stuff. Commit again. 

3. **Create a blog post:** 
If you do not have a blog, start one on blogspot, WordPress, medium or anywhere else you want.

2. **Design Task:** 
Use Figma to design yourself a home page. Your page must follow a particular format: Your picture on the top left corner. Links below your picture About, Blog, Projects. Below that are three icons with links to your social media. On the right (separated by a line from the left section), will be some welcoming information for you.
